# hello-world
Follow this Hello World exercise to get started with GitHub.
You can make and save changes to the files in your repository. On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes so that other contributors can understand what youâ€™ve done and why.
By completing this tutorial, you've learned to create a project and make a pull request on GitHub.

Here's what you accomplished in this tutorial:

Created an open source repository
Started and managed a new branch
Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub
Opened and merged a pull request
Take a look at your GitHub profile and you'll see your work reflected on your contribution graph.

For more information about the power of branches and pull requests, see "GitHub flow." For more information about getting started with GitHub, see the other guides in the getting started quickstart.
